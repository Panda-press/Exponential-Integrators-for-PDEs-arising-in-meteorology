  abstract      = {Nowadays, many fields of study are have to deal with large and sparse data matrixes, but the most important issue is finding the inverse of these matrixes. Thankfully, Krylov subspace methods can be used in solving these types of problem. However, it is difficult to understand mathematical principles behind these methods. In the first part of the article, Krylov methods are discussed in detail. Thus, readers equipped with a basic knowledge of linear algebra should be able to understand these methods. In this part, the knowledge of Krylov methods are put into some examples for simple implementations of a commonly known Krylov method GMRES. In the second part, the article talks about CG iteration, a wildly known method which is very similar to Krylov methods. By comparison between CG iteration and Krylov methods, readers can get a better comprehension of Krylov methods based on CG iteration. In the third part of the article, aiming to improve the efficiency of Krylov methods, preconditioners are discussed. In addition, the restarting GMRES is briefly introduced to reduce the space consumption of Krylov methods in this part.},

A powerful way to consider this problem is to use Krylov subspace methods. The purpose of this work is to approximate the matrix exponential and some Cauchy-Stieltjes functions on a block vectors B of R^n*p using a rational block Lanczos algorithm. We also derive some error estimates and error bound for the convergence of the rational approximation and finally numerical results attest to the computational efficiency of the proposed method.},

  abstract      = {Computation of the large sparse matrix exponential has been an important topic in many fields, such as network and finite-element analysis. The existing scaling and squaring algorithm (SSA) is not suitable for the computation of the large sparse matrix exponential as it requires greater memories and computational cost than is actually needed. By introducing two novel concepts, i.e., real bandwidth and bandwidth, to measure the sparsity of the matrix, the sparsity of the matrix exponential is analyzed. It is found that for every matrix computed in the squaring phase of the SSA, a corresponding sparse approximate matrix exists. To obtain the sparse approximate matrix, a new filtering technique in terms of forward error analysis is proposed. Combining the filtering technique with the idea of keeping track of the incremental part, a competitive algorithm is developed for the large sparse matrix exponential. The proposed method can primarily alleviate the over-scaling problem due to the filtering technique. Three sets of numerical experiments, including one large matrix with a dimension larger than 2e6 , are conducted. The numerical experiments show that, compared with the expm function in MATLAB, the proposed algorithm can provide higher accuracy at lower computational cost and with less memory.},

This algorithm is suitable for large-scale problems in computational physics where little or no information about the spectrum or norm of the Jacobian matrix is known a priori. We first show that such problems can be solved efficiently by computing a single exponential of a modified matrix. Then our approach is to compute an appropriate basis for the Krylov subspace using the incomplete orthogonalization procedure and project the matrix exponential on this subspace. We also present a novel adaptive procedure that significantly reduces the computational complexity of exponential integrators. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that KIOPS outperforms the current state-of-the-art adaptive Krylov algorithm phipm.},
